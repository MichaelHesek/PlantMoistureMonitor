# PlantMoistureMonitor
This project includes a sample .NET application that simulates a plant monitoring system.  The current visualization utilizes a console application but further UI/notification methods could be incorporated.  It will check the soil moisture levels, and based on the reading it will send a notification if moisture is too low.
