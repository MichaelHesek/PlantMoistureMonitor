# PlantMoistureMonitor
This project includes a sample .NET application that simulates a plant monitoring system.  The current visualization utilizes a console application but further UI/notification methods could be incorporated.  It will check the soil moisture levels, and based on the reading it will send a notification if moisture is too low.

## Features
- Clean architecture
- Dependency injection
- Unit testing with xUnit

## Usage
dotnet run --project PlantMoistureMonitor.ConsoleApp

## Future Improvements
- Real sensor integration
- Email or SMS notifications
- Configurable thresholds
